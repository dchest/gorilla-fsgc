Package fsgc provides a garbage collector for gorilla/session FilesystemStore.

It collects old sessions based on file modification timestamps.

Example:

  path := "/path/to/sessions/"
  store := sessions.NewFilesystemStore(path, []byte("secret"))
  gc := fsgc.New(path).MaxAge(12 * time.Hour).Interval(30 * time.Minute)
  gc.Start()
  //
  // Every 30 minutes gc will remove any sessions files older than 12 hours
  // from /path/to/sessions/. When shutting down server, stop the collector.
  //
  gc.Stop()
